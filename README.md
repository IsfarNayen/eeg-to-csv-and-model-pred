*Introduction*

- With time, alcoholism continues to spread, gradually affecting our society bit by bit. Alcoholism, or Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), is a chronic disease characterized by an inability to stop or reduce alcohol consumption despite adverse consequences. It involves physical dependence on alcohol, increased tolerance to its effects, and withdrawal symptoms when consumption is reduced or stopped. The long-term consequences of alcoholism include psychological, social, and physical health disturbances.

- An electroencephalogram (EEG) records brain activity using electrodes placed on the scalp, capturing electrical signals from neurons. It provides insights into brain function by measuring different brain waves—delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma—each linked to specific mental states such as sleep or cognition. Studies have shown that Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) alters EEG signals, particularly in the frontal and parietal regions, which are crucial for decision-making and attention.

*Performance Test*

This section presents three graphical analyses of EEG responses:  
1. **Stimulus Response:** The first graph illustrates EEG samples collected from both the controlled and alcoholic groups as they were shown images of various objects.  
2. **No-Matching Condition:** The second graph highlights a cognitive task where participants identified whether objects were the same. The controlled group performed well, whereas the alcoholic group struggled in non-matching conditions.  
3. **Matching Condition:** The third graph demonstrates that both groups performed similarly when the objects matched.
