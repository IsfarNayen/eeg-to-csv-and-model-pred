Introduction

- With time, alcoholism continues to spread, gradually affecting our society bit by bit. Alcoholism, or Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), is a chronic disease characterized by an inability to stop or reduce alcohol consumption despite adverse consequences. It involves physical dependence on alcohol, increased tolerance to its effects, and withdrawal symptoms when consumption is reduced or stopped. The long-term consequences of alcoholism include psychological, social, and physical health disturbances.

- An electroencephalogram (EEG) records brain activity using electrodes placed on the scalp, capturing electrical signals from neurons. It provides insights into brain function by measuring different brain waves—delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma—each linked to specific mental states such as sleep or cognition. Studies have shown that Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) alters EEG signals, particularly in the frontal and parietal regions, which are crucial for decision-making and attention.
